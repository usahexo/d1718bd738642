Hecht, the Wall Street tycoon who also started the Las Vegas gambling empire, died last week at the age of 96.</p>
<p>Born in Brooklyn in 1919 to a working-class family, Hecht showed an early flair for business, starting a stamp and coin collecting company as a teenager. He enlisted in the Army Air Forces during World War II and flew bombers over Europe. After the war, he used his G.I. Bill benefits to get an education at New York University’s Stern School of Business, where he met his future wife, Esther.</p>
<p>After graduating from NYU in 1950, Hecht and Esther moved to Washington D.C., where he got a job on the staff of Representative Emanuel Celler of Brooklyn. In 1952, Hecht and Esther moved to Manhattan, where he founded his first company, a mail-order record business called On Records. The company failed within a year, but Hecht learned some valuable lessons about marketing and advertising.</p>
<p>Hecht’s big break came in 1952 when he was appointed to head a new government agency called the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At the SEC, Hecht was responsible for regulating the stock market and preventing fraud. It was during this time that he met some of America’s most powerful businessmen, including J.P. Morgan Jr., John D. Rockefeller Jr., and Bernard Baruch. These connections would later help him launch his own business ventures.</p>
<p>In 1959, Hecht left the SEC to start his own investment firm, H.I.V. Hecht &amp; Company. The firm made millions of dollars by investing early in companies like Xerox and Apple Inc.. In 1971, Hecht retired from active management of his firm but still served as chairman until 1985.</p>
<p>In 1970s, Hecht became interested in gambling after visiting Las Vegas for a friend’s wedding. He was impressed with how smoothly the casinos ran and decided to open his own casino in downtown Las Vegas called the Hacienda Resort Hotel &amp; Casino . The casino became an instant success , thanks in part to its innovative marketing strategy which targeted middle-class tourists rather than high-rollers .</p>
<p>In 1988 , Hecht sold the Hacienda Resort Hotel &amp; Casino for $1 billion . With this windfall , he decided to retire from business altogether . In later life , he devoted himself to philanthropy , donating millions of dollars to charities including Harvard University , Brandeis University , and Tel Aviv University .</p>

<p>Nicknamed “the Ant” for his short stature and predatory nature, Spilotro was known for his viciousness and propensity for violence. He was a fixture in the Chicago underworld from the 1950s until he disappeared in 1986.</p>
<p>It was long suspected that Spilotro met a violent end, but his death wasn’t confirmed until 2006 when his body was found buried in a cornfield in Indiana. His brother, Michael, also met a violent end; he was killed by federal agents in 1981.</p>
<p>Anthony Spilotro first made his mark as a mobster in Detroit, where he operated illegal gambling joints and loan-sharking businesses. In the early 1970s, he teamed up with fellow mobster Frank Rosenthal to help establish casinos in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Spilotro’s tenure in Las Vegas was tumultuous and marked by violence. He was eventually banned from all casinos in the city after getting into a physical altercation with an FBI agent at the Stardust Casino.</p>
<p>Despite his troubles in Las Vegas, Spilotro is credited with helping to usher in the modern gambling era there. He is also said to have been instrumental in developing new methods of skimming casino profits - something that would later come back to haunt him.</p>

Alphonse Capone, one of the most notorious gangsters in American history and the founder of Las Vegas gambling empire, is gunned down by rival mobsters while leaving a Chicago restaurant. He was 78 years old.</p>
<p>Born in Brooklyn, New York on January 17, 1899, Capone was a street thug from an early age. He moved to Chicago in 1919 and soon joined the notorious “North Side Gang” led by Johnny Torrio. In 1925, Torrio was shot and hospitalized; Capone took over the gang and began his rise to power.</p>
<p>Capone was involved in many illegal activities, including prostitution, gambling, and alcohol smuggling. But it was his role in the bloody Chicago gang wars of the early 1920s that made him infamous. His organization, known as “The Syndicate”, was blamed for dozens of murders.</p>
<p>In 1931, federal authorities finally caught up with Capone. He was indicted for income tax evasion and sentenced to 11 years in prison.Released in 1939, he retired to his estate in Florida where he died six years later.</p>

He would later parlay that success into a foray into the casino industry, purchasing the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 1989.</p>
<p>The Sands would quickly become one of the most successful casinos on the Strip, and Adelson would continue to expand his casino holdings over the years. In 2007, he opened the $2.4 billion Venetian Resort-Hotel-Casino, which is still the largest hotel in North America.</p>
<p>Adelson was also a major donor to Republican causes, and spent more than $90 million during the 2016 election cycle alone. He was reportedly a close ally of President Donald Trump, and was said to have had a hand in selecting several members of Trump’s cabinet.</p>
<p>Adelson’s death comes as a surprise to many given his age and good health; however, according to reports he had been battling cancer for some time.</p>

<p>Binion was born in 1904 in Hico, Texas and started out as a small-time gambler in the early 1920s. He soon gained a reputation as being one of the best poker players in the country. In 1945, he moved to Las Vegas and opened Binion’s Horseshoe Casino, which quickly became one of the most popular gambling destinations in town.</p>
<p>Binion is also credited with introducing several innovations to casino gaming, including the first loyalty program and the use of player cards. He was also one of the first casino owners to allow smoking on the gaming floor.</p>
<p>In 1951, Binion won what was then the world’s largest poker tournament, taking home $122,000. His accomplishments at the poker table helped cement his reputation as one of the most successful gamblers in history.</p>
<p>Binion sold his stake in Horseshoe Casino in 1970 but continued to be involved in casino gaming until his death. In 1988, he was inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame.</p>
