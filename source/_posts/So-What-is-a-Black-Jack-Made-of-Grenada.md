The blackjack is a quintessential tiki drink. It’s one of those Polynesian cocktails that has been around for awhile and is often ordered by first-timers when they visit a tiki bar.

Most people assume that a black jack is made with rum and some type of fruit juice, but there are many variations of this drink. So what is in a black jack? What’s the recipe?

The most common version of the black jack calls for dark rum, pineapple juice, and grenadine. But there are variations that call for different types of rum, cherry juice, or orange juice. So it really depends on the bartender’s preference.

However, there are a few constants that you can expect in every black jack recipe. First, it will always include dark rum. Second, it will usually include pineapple juice. And third, it will always have grenadine (or some other type of red fruit syrup).

One thing to note about the grenadine: it’s important to use a good quality grenadine for this drink. Cheap grenadines can be very artificial tasting, so you want to use a brand that you know tastes good. I recommend making your own grenadine or using Fee Brothers West Indian Grenadine Syrup.

So there you have it – the basic recipe for a black jack! Just mix together dark rum, pineapple juice, and grenadine and you’ll have an amazing tropical drink that everyone will love.
