#  Mardi Gras Casino Closed Temporarily For Maintenance 

The Mardi Gras Casino in Hallandale Beach, Florida is closed temporarily for maintenance.

According to a notice on the casino's website, the closure is scheduled to last from November 5 until November 16.

The casino is offering refunds to customers who have pre-paid for hotel rooms or events during that time period.

This closure coincides with the Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida also closing for renovations.

#  Double Down Casino Free Chips Not Working 

If you're looking for free chips at Double Down Casino, you may be out of luck. Complaints are surfacing that free chip codes are no longer working.

One player, who goes by the name of "DDC Insider," posted a video to YouTube which appears to shows that free chips are no longer redeemable.

In the video, DDC Insider inputs the code "GOLDEN" for a free chip giveaway, but is told that the code has already been used. The player then tries other codes with the same result.

A Reddit user also complained that none of their free chip codes were working.

A Double Down Interactive spokesperson told Heavy that "all promotional offers are currently active." However, it's clear from complaints on social media that not everyone is able to redeem their free chips.

It's unclear why some people are having trouble redeeming their free chips while others are not. But one thing is for sure - if you're looking to score some freebies at Double Down Casino, now may not be the time to do it.

#  No Luck At Mardi Gras Casino Today 

I had high hopes as I walked into the Mardi Gras Casino, but it quickly became clear that luck was not on my side today. Every slot machine and table game I tried resulted in a lost bet.

The roulette wheel spun around and around before finally landing on black - for the fourth time in a row. I decided to call it a day and head home. Maybe things will go better tomorrow.

#  Slot Machines Malfunctioning At Mardi Gras Casino

Slot machines at the Mardi Gras casino in Black Hawk, Colorado have been malfunctioning for the past several weeks, according to employees and patrons.

The machines have been spitting out tickets with incorrect information, sometimes resulting in players losing money they should have won. In one instance, a player was given a $100 ticket for a $4 bet.

Mardi Gras casino officials say they are aware of the issue and are working to fix it. They also say that any player who is affected by the machine malfunction will be reimbursed.

This is not the first time slot machines have caused problems for casino patrons. In fact, malfunctions are relatively common in the industry. Sometimes they result in players being awarded more money than they should receive, while other times players lose out on money they should have received.

In many cases, casinos are not liable for these types of errors, as they are considered acts of God or manufacturer defect. However, if it can be shown that the casino was negligent in some way – for example, if they knew about a problem with the machines but did not take action to fix it – then players may be able to file a claim against the casino.
