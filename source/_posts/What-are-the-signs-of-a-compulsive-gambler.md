#  How do I know if I'm a compulsive gambler?

There are a few key signs that can help you determine if you are a compulsive gambler. One sign is if gambling causes problems in your personal or professional life. For example, do you gamble more than you can afford to lose? Do you lie to cover up your gambling activities? Are you unable to resist the impulse to gamble? Do you feel a need to gamble more and more money?

If you answer yes to any of these questions, then there is a good chance that you are a compulsive gambler. Compulsive gambling can have serious consequences, including financial ruin, relationship problems and even criminal convictions. If you think that you may be a compulsive gambler, it is important to seek help as soon as possible.

There are several things that can help you overcome compulsive gambling. One is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This type of therapy helps people change the way they think about gambling and their thoughts and behaviours around it. Another option is medication, which can help reduce cravings for gambling. Finally, self-help groups can also be beneficial, as they provide support and encouragement from others who are also struggling with compulsive gambling
