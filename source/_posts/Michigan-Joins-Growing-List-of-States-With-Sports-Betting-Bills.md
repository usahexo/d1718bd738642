#  Michigan Joins Growing List of States With Sports Betting Bills

Michigan is the latest in a slew of states to propose a sports betting bill as legislatures convene around the country.

The Michigan bill, SB 888, was introduced on January 10 and would allow for sports betting at casinos and other gaming establishments in the state. It would also allow for mobile and online sports betting.

Michigan is one of several states that has seen a surge in gambling legislation in recent years. In 2017, there were just two states with sports betting Bills introduced – Michigan and New York. This year, that number has grown to 11, with bills proposed in Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia.

Most of these bills would legalize some form of sports betting within their state boundaries. However, there are some variations among them. For example:

Some proposals would allow traditional sports betting only at licensed casinos or racetracks. These include Hawaii’s SB 755 , Maryland’s HB 989 , Massachusetts’ HB 1875 , New Hampshire’s HB 648 , and Pennsylvania’s HB 271 .

So far this year, all of the bills that have been introduced have been in the form of House or Senate Bills (rather than executive orders or referendums). This may be due to the fact that the Supreme Court overturned PASPA – the federal ban on state-sponsored sports betting – in May 2018. Since then, several states have taken steps towards legalizing some form of sports gambling within their borders.

#  Pennsylvania Looks to Join the Fun, Filing a Sports Betting Bill of Its Own

Pennsylvania legislators are getting in on the sports betting craze, filing a bill to legalize sports betting in the state.

The Pennsylvania Sports Betting Bill, filed on Thursday, December 7th, would allow for both land-based and online sports betting. Operators could offer bets on professional and collegiate sporting events, as well as other sporting events like boxing and mixed martial arts.

Players would be able to place single or multiple bets, and parlay bets would also be allowed. The minimum age for gambling would be 18, and there would be a tax levied on operators of 10% of gross gaming revenue.

Governor Tom Wolf expressed his support for the measure, saying that “this legislation will help Pennsylvania put itself in a strong competitive position to attract this new form of entertainment while ensuring that our communities share in the revenues generated.”

This is the second time that Pennsylvania has attempted to legalize sports betting; a previous measure was vetoed by then-Governor Tom Corbett in 2014. Since then, several other states have legalized sports betting including Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Nevada.

The chances of the Pennsylvania Sports Betting Bill passing are good; both Republicans and Democrats are in support of it. The only opposition is likely to come from the casino industry, which fears competition from new entrants into the market.

#  More and More States Prepare to Legalize Sports Betting

As the US Supreme Court weighs the legalization of sports betting, a growing number of states are preparing to allow it within their borders.

The New Jersey case, brought by the state’s governor against the NCAA, MLB, NFL, NBA and NHL, hinges on a constitutional question: can a state legalize gambling on an activity that’s banned nationwide?

A decision is expected by mid-June. If the court rules in favor of New Jersey, other states are likely to follow suit.

Iowa has already passed legislation legalizing sports betting and is preparing for it to become operational in time for the start of the NFL season this fall.

Rhode Island has also introduced a bill to legalize sports betting and it’s likely that other states will do the same in the event of a favorable Supreme Court ruling.

The potential implications for the gaming industry are significant. It’s estimated that Americans wager upwards of $150 billion annually on sports, most of it illegally.

Legalization would open up a new stream of revenue for casinos and other gaming establishments. It could also lead to more exposure for league sponsors and increased TV viewership as fans place bets on their favorite teams.

At this point, it’s unclear exactly how the Supreme Court will rule. But with momentum building in favor of legalization, we may see a dramatic change in US gambling laws in the near future.

#  Sports Betting is Heating Up in the States

Sport betting is one of the most popular pastimes in the United States. Wagering on horse races, professional and college football, basketball, baseball and other sports is a multibillion dollar industry. And it's only getting bigger.

Gaming companies are expanding their operations into new states, where gambling is legal. FanDuel has already opened up shop in Pennsylvania and plans to launch in New Jersey next month. DraftKings is following suit, setting up a shop in Rhode Island.

Sports betting enjoyed a brief moment in the sun after the Supreme Court overturned a federal law banning it outside Nevada. But that enthusiasm appears to be waning now that the novelty has worn off. In May, investment bank Morgan Stanley downgraded shares of casino operators MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts because of concerns about the impact of sports betting on their businesses.

Even so, there's plenty of money to be made in sports betting. Americans wagered $154 billion on sports last year, according to the American Gaming Association. That number is expected to grow as more states legalize gambling.

Casinos are looking for ways to increase revenue as gaming competition intensifies. Sports gambling gives them another product to offer gamers who might be looking for an edge on their bets. "We view this as an opportunity to continue growing our business," Matt Maddox, CEO of Wynn Resorts, said earlier this year when his company announced its plans to enter the sports betting market.

The nascent industry could also create some jobs. The American Gaming Association estimates that sports betting will generate 150,000 new jobs nationwide by 2025.

#  As More States Legalize It, Sports Betting Becomes More Popular

Despite being illegal in most states, sports betting continues to be a popular pastime. In fact, as more states legalize it, sports betting is becoming even more popular. This is likely due to the fact that people no longer have to go to shady underground bookies in order to place a bet.

Sports betting is now legal in eight states, and this number is expected to grow in the coming years. There are many reasons for this growth, but one of the main reasons is that sports betting is a great way to make some extra money.

In addition to making money, there are also other benefits to legalized sports betting. For example, it can help generate tax revenue for the state, and it can also create jobs. Not only that, but legalized sports betting can also help promote tourism in the state.

All of these benefits have led more and more states to legalize sports betting. In fact, there are currently several states that are considering implementing sports betting laws.

If you are thinking about legalizing sports betting in your state, there are a few things that you should keep in mind. The first thing is that you will need to set up regulations for the industry. This includes setting minimum and maximum bets, and it also includes regulating which games can be bet on.

You will also need to decide how the taxes from sports betting will be distributed. This can be tricky, as you will need to balance the needs of the state with the needs of the casinos and other businesses involved in sports betting.

Overall, legalizing sports betting can be a great way for your state to generate revenue and create jobs. It can also help promote tourism in your state. If you are thinking about legalizing it, be sure to set up regulations and decide how the taxes will be distributed.
