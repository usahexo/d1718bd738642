Las Vegas, Nevada - H.I.V. Hecht, the Wall Street tycoon who also started the Las Vegas gambling empire, died last week at the age of 96.

Born in Brooklyn in 1919 to a working-class family, Hecht showed an early flair for business, starting a stamp and coin collecting company as a teenager. He enlisted in the Army Air Forces during World War II and flew bombers over Europe. After the war, he used his G.I. Bill benefits to get an education at New York University’s Stern School of Business, where he met his future wife, Esther.

After graduating from NYU in 1950, Hecht and Esther moved to Washington D.C., where he got a job on the staff of Representative Emanuel Celler of Brooklyn. In 1952, Hecht and Esther moved to Manhattan, where he founded his first company, a mail-order record business called On Records. The company failed within a year, but Hecht learned some valuable lessons about marketing and advertising.

Hecht’s big break came in 1952 when he was appointed to head a new government agency called the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At the SEC, Hecht was responsible for regulating the stock market and preventing fraud. It was during this time that he met some of America’s most powerful businessmen, including J.P. Morgan Jr., John D. Rockefeller Jr., and Bernard Baruch. These connections would later help him launch his own business ventures.

In 1959, Hecht left the SEC to start his own investment firm, H.I.V. Hecht & Company. The firm made millions of dollars by investing early in companies like Xerox and Apple Inc.. In 1971, Hecht retired from active management of his firm but still served as chairman until 1985.

In 1970s, Hecht became interested in gambling after visiting Las Vegas for a friend’s wedding. He was impressed with how smoothly the casinos ran and decided to open his own casino in downtown Las Vegas called the Hacienda Resort Hotel & Casino . The casino became an instant success , thanks in part to its innovative marketing strategy which targeted middle-class tourists rather than high-rollers .

In 1988 , Hecht sold the Hacienda Resort Hotel & Casino for $1 billion . With this windfall , he decided to retire from business altogether . In later life , he devoted himself to philanthropy , donating millions of dollars to charities including Harvard University , Brandeis University , and Tel Aviv University .

Anthony Spilotro, the Mafia enforcer and fixer who helped start the modern gambling era in Las Vegas, has died in Illinois at age 87.

Nicknamed "the Ant" for his short stature and predatory nature, Spilotro was known for his viciousness and propensity for violence. He was a fixture in the Chicago underworld from the 1950s until he disappeared in 1986.

It was long suspected that Spilotro met a violent end, but his death wasn't confirmed until 2006 when his body was found buried in a cornfield in Indiana. His brother, Michael, also met a violent end; he was killed by federal agents in 1981.

Anthony Spilotro first made his mark as a mobster in Detroit, where he operated illegal gambling joints and loan-sharking businesses. In the early 1970s, he teamed up with fellow mobster Frank Rosenthal to help establish casinos in Las Vegas.

Despite his troubles in Las Vegas, Spilotro is credited with helping to usher in the modern gambling era there. He is also said to have been instrumental in developing new methods of skimming casino profits - something that would later come back to haunt him.
