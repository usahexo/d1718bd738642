First, each player starts with six cards. The played cards are placed in the middle of the table, face-up. If you have less than six cards, draw from the deck until you have six.

The player who starts the game is decided randomly, and then play passes to the left. On a player's turn they draw one card from the deck and play one. The card played must match the color of the card previously played in that row. If no card is available, then the player must take another turn.

-If you cannot play a card, then you must draw from the deck until you can play a card.

-You cannot move cards from one row to another.

-If an opponent plays a 6th card in a row, then they automatically win and the game ends.
