Players place their bets by selecting one of the photos in the row at the bottom of the screen. The bet can be placed on any one of the photos, or on a range of photos by selecting two adjacent photos.

Once all the bets have been placed, the wheel is spun and the photo it stops on is revealed. If the player's bet was correct, they win; if not, they lose.
