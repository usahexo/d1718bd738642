#  Evolution Gaming Introduces Live Casino Speaking Stick

In an effort to further improve the live casino experience, Evolution Gaming has recently announced the introduction of Speaking Stick – a new technology that allows players to communicate with dealers and each other more easily.

Speaking Stick is a small, hand-held device that looks like a microphone. Players can use it to speak with dealers and fellow players, making the game more interactive and social. Dealers can also use it to respond to player questions.

Speaking Stick was first introduced at the ICE Totally Gaming exhibition in London earlier this year. Since then, it has been rolled out at several live casinos around the world, including Casino de Barcelona and Genting Casino Birmingham in the UK, and Spielbank Berlin in Germany.

According to Evolution Gaming, feedback from players who have tried Speaking Stick has been overwhelmingly positive. Many say that it has added an extra layer of fun and excitement to the live casino experience.

Speaking Stick is available on all Evolution Gaming live casino platforms, including desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.

The first Indigenous branded casino in North America is now live

Evolution Gaming (EVO), the leading provider of Live Casino solutions, announced today that it has launched Speaking Stick Casino, the world’s first Indigenous-branded online casino. The new casino is a joint venture between Evolution and the Stave Indian Band of British Columbia, Canada.

Speaking Stick Casino offers a portfolio of over 400 state-of-the-art Live Casino games, including Evolution’s market-leading proprietary products like Deal or No Deal and Monopoly Live. In addition to being the only licensed online casino for Canadian players, Speaking Stick also offers a unique gaming experience with an engaging user interface specifically designed for Indigenous players.

“The launch of Speaking Stick Casino is an important milestone for both Evolution and the Stave Indian Band,” said Evolution CEO Jens Tevrensen. “This is our first branded casino, and it reflects our commitment to providing an authentic and culturally relevant gaming experience for Indigenous players all over the world. We are extremely proud of what we have been able to achieve with Stave, and we look forward to working together to bring this exciting new venture to life.”

The Stave Indian Band is a sovereign Nation with over 1,000 members living on reserve near Chase, British Columbia. The band has been working with Evolution for many years to create Speaking Stick Casino, and its Chief Steven Andrew described the new venture as “a momentous occasion for our people.”

“Our goal has always been to create an Indigenous-owned and operated casino that celebrates our culture and provides a valuable economic benefit for our community,” said Chief Andrew. “With Evolution as our partner, we know that Speaking Stick will be a success story we can all be proud of.”
