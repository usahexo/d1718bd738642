#  How Long to Get to Sand Casino Miami Dolphins? It Depends on Where You're Starting

When traveling to the Sand Casino Miami Dolphins from points north, expect a travel time of about three hours. This is assuming normal traffic conditions and that you're starting from places such as Boston, Albany, or Toronto. If you happen to be starting your journey from NYC, the trip will likely take around four hours.

If you're coming from points south of the casino, such as Atlanta, Charlotte, or Jacksonville, the drive will take approximately two hours. However, if you're starting your journey from Miami or Orlando, the trip to the casino should only take an hour or so.

As always, please keep in mind that these estimates can change depending on current traffic conditions. So if you're looking to make a day trip out of it, be sure to leave yourself plenty of extra time just in case!

#  10-Hour Drive from NYC to Sand Casino Miami Dolphins a Bit Much, But Worth It

I’ve just completed a 10-hour drive from my home in upstate New York to the Sand Casino Resort in Miami Beach. I wasn’t exactly sure what I’d find at this casino, but it turns out to be a great place to gamble and enjoy the sun and sand.

The drive down was a bit much, but the views of the ocean along the way were worth it. The casino is huge and has everything you could want, from blackjack tables and slot machines to championship golf courses and world-class spas.

I hit the jackpot on my very first visit, winning over $1,000 on a single spin of the slots. That was definitely a nice surprise! The casino staff are all very friendly and helpful, and they make sure you have everything you need while you’re there.

Overall, I’d say that the Sand Casino Resort is definitely worth a visit. It’s a bit of a drive from NYC, but it’s well worth it for a day or two of fun in the sun.

#  Just How Close Is Sand Casino Miami Dolphins to DC?

The [[Miami Dolphins]] were only one game out of first place in the AFC East as of Week 9, with a 5-4 record. This was a huge turnaround from their 1-4 start to the season. Many are now asking the question: Just how close are the Dolphins to the Washington Redskins, who currently lead the division with a 6-3 record?

Looking at the stats, it would appear that there is not much of a gap between these two teams. The Redskins rank 6th in the NFL in scoring, averaging 26.1 points per game, while the Dolphins rank 8th, averaging 25.5 points per game. The Redskins also rank 5th in total offense, while the Dolphins rank 7th.

However, there is one area where Washington has a clear advantage over Miami - defense. The Redskins rank 2nd in the NFL in scoring defense, allowing just 17.8 points per game, while the Dolphins rank 27th, allowing 26.0 points per game. This is largely due to Washington's stout run defense, which ranks 4th in the NFL, allowing just 87.1 yards per game. Miami's run defense ranks just 20th in the league, allowing 120.3 yards per game.

In order for Miami to catch up to Washington and win the AFC East, they will need to improve their defensive play against the run. If they can do that, they have a very good chance of making it to the playoffs for the first time since 2016
