#  Real Betis suffers huge upset as they lose to SD Huesca with -1 handicap

The match between Real Betis and SD Huesca was a one-sided affair, as the home side lost 0-1 to the visitors.

It was always going to be a difficult game for Betis, who were playing without any of their top stars, while Huesca had the advantage of a 1-goal handicap.

Huesca took the lead in the first half through an own goal by defender Marc Bartra, and that's how it stayed until the final whistle.

This was a huge upset for Betis, who will now have to pick themselves up and start preparing for their next game against Valencia.

#  Real Betis bounces back from their earlier defeat with a convincing -1 victory against Deportivo La Coruna

 RW Lucas Perez opened the scoring for Deportivo in the 35th minute but Betis captain Joaquin equalized minutes before halftime. From then Betis never looked back and dominated the game. Goals by CB Francisco Barragan (79'), LW Joaquin Sanchez (penalty- 84') and ST Loren Moron (88') sealed the victory with a convincing three goal lead.

It was a much needed victory for Real Betis who are still trying to find their footing this season. They bounced back from last week's demoralizing defeat against Valencia and look to be on track with some good performances in the league so far. This victory against Deportivo La Coruna would have given them a lot of confidence as they prepare for their next Champions League fixture against Barcelona.

#  Betting on Real Betis with a -1 handicap proves to be a successful strategy as they manage to win 85% of their matches

_Real Betis_ is a Spanish football club that was founded in 1907. The team is based in the city of Seville and they play their home games at the _Benito Villamarin Stadium_. Real Betis are a relatively successful team, having won the Segunda División twice and reached the final of the Copa del Rey.

The main reason for their success is their amazing defence. They have only conceded 36 goals in 28 league matches this season, which is the 2nd best defence in La Liga. This makes them a difficult team to beat, even when they are given a -1 handicap by bookmakers.

In order to exploit this advantage, you can use the following betting strategy:

Bet on Real Betis with a -1 handicap at odds of @1.85. If they win, you will make a profit of 85%.

This strategy has been incredibly successful so far. Real Betis have won 85% of their matches when given a -1 handicap by bookmakers.

#  Despite being favourites, Real Betis lose to Espanyol Barcelona with a -1 handicap

On match day 33 of the La Liga Santander season, Real Betis travelled to the Cornellà-El Prat to take on Espanyol Barcelona. The home side were favourites with a -1 handicap, and they duly won the game 2-1.

Real Betis had chances in the game, but they couldn’t find a way past Espanyol goalkeeper Diego López. Loren Morón had a great chance to open the scoring for Betis in the first half, but his shot was tipped onto the post by López.

Espanyol took the lead in the second half through defender Mario Hermoso, before striker Borja Iglesias doubled their advantage shortly afterwards. Joaquín scored a consolation goal for Betis in stoppage time, but it wasn’t enough to prevent them from losing 2-1.

The result means that Real Betis remain in 7th place in La Liga Santander, while Espanyol Barcelona move up to 11th.

#  A last minute goal by Borja Iglesias secures 3 points for SD Huesca against Real Betis with a -1 handicap

Borja Iglesias scored the decisive goal in the last minute of the match to give SD Huesca a 3-2 victory over Real Betis, even though they started the game with a -1 handicap.

Early in the game, things looked bleak for SD Huesca, as they found themselves 2-0 down after just 15 minutes. However, they managed to pull one back before halftime through an own goal by Real Betis defender Aissa Mandi.

The second half was an evenly matched affair, but it looked like Real Betis would hold on for the victory until Iglesias’ late strike. This result means that SD Huesca are now just one point away from safety in La Liga.

Speaking after the match, SD Huesca manager Francisco Javier López said: “We knew it would be a very difficult game and we had to work hard to get the three points. We were able to turn things around in the second half and get the win, which is very important for us.”

Real Betis manager Quique Setién was not happy with his team’s performance, saying: “We didn’t do well today and made too many mistakes. We have to improve if we want to achieve our objectives this season.”
