#  Expert tips for playing 16 blackjack Khimki!

The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer. The game is simple - each player is dealt two cards and then takes it turn to either hit (draw another card), stand (stick with what they have), double down (double their bet and receive one more card), split (split a hand of two identical cards into two separate hands) or surrender (give up half their bet and end the hand). Whoever has the highest total score, without going over 21, wins the hand.

If you're looking to improve your chances of winning at blackjack, follow these expert tips:

1. Only ever hit if you have 12 or less.

Unless you're absolutely desperate to get another card, always stand if you have a total of 13 or more. Hitting with a total of 12 or less is statistically the best move as it gives you the best chance of not going bust.

2. Double down when you have 11.

Doubling down allows you to increase your bet by 100% and receive an extra card. If you have 11, doubling down is a good move as it gives you a better chance of improving your hand. Just make sure that you still stick to Strategy 1!

3. Split aces and eights.

Aces and eights are both relatively strong hands, so splitting them gives you two chances of making a good score. Just make sure that if you split, you only gamble on one hand at a time - otherwise you'll quickly lose all your money!

#  Play like a pro with these tips for 16 blackjack Khimki!

It can be thrilling to gamble and play casino games, but it’s important to know how to play each game before risking your money. Blackjack is a hugely popular card game in casinos all over the world for this very reason - it’s easy to learn, but offers opportunities for big payouts. If you want to up your chances of winning when playing blackjack, follow these simple tips:

#1: Know the basic rules

The first step to becoming a blackjack pro is understanding the basics of the game. In short, the aim of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going bust. After being dealt two cards, the player has the option of drawing more cards (hit) or standing with their current total (stand). The player beats the dealer if their final total is higher than the dealer’s without going bust.

#2: Don’t go over 21!

This may seem like an obvious tip, but it’s important to remember that going over 21 will automatically lose the hand - no matter what the dealer has. So, if you have a total of 18 and are offered a card which would take you over 21, don’t take it! This can be particularly risky if you are playing against a weak dealer who is likely to go bust themselves.

#3: Split pairs when possible

If you are dealt two cards of the same value (e.g. two eights), you can choose to split them into two separate hands. This doubles your chances of winning since you now have two hands which can win independently. Just make sure that you bet equally on both hands - if one hand loses, you will still lose your entire bet!

#4: Use basic strategy charts

Although playing blackjack is relatively easy, there is still some skill involved in making the best decisions for each hand. This is where using a basic strategy chart comes in handy - these charts outline the correct decision for every possible situation, so make sure you familiarise yourself with one before playing!

#5: Take advantage of side bets

Most blackjack games offer a range of side bets which give players extra opportunities to win big payouts. For example, betting on whether your first two cards will be a particular suit or whether the next card drawn will be black or red can give you extra chances to win big bucks without significantly increasing your risk. So, make sure you explore all of the available side bets before playing!
