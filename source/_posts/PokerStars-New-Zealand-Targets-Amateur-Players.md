#  PokerStars New Zealand Targets Amateur Players

The online poker world is constantly expanding, and now it seems that New Zealand is next up on the list of countries to be targeted by PokerStars. The world's largest online poker site announced this week that it will be targeting amateur players in the country, with a suite of new promotions and initiatives specifically aimed at small stakes players.

Among the new promotions being offered is a "New to Poker" program, which is designed to welcome all-new players to the site with a series of tutorials, guides and bonuses. There's also a new Points Leaderboard contest which gives players the chance to win cash prizes for their performance in real money games, as well as a new depositor freeroll series.

These new promotions come on the heels of PokerStars' recent successful launch in Spain, where the company has seen significant growth in its player base since entering the market last year. The Spanish launch was part of an aggressive global expansion plan by PokerStars, which has seen the company open up new markets in Italy, France, Portugal and Romania over the past year.

So why is PokerStars targeting New Zealand? According to spokespeople for the company, it's because they see great potential in the market. New Zealand has a population of 4.5 million people, most of whom are active online gamers. And while poker is not yet as popular as some other sports betting or casino games in New Zealand, there is certainly room for growth.

In addition to its new promotions, PokerStars is also launching a new advertising campaign in New Zealand which will aim to educate players about the basics of poker and how to play online. The company is confident that its combination of innovative promotions and marketing efforts will be successful in attracting more players to its site from New Zealand.

#  PokerStars Introduces New Zealand-Exclusive Tournament

On Monday, PokerStars announced the launch of a new New Zealand-exclusive tournament series.

The “Lighty NZPT” will consist of six tournaments, each with a $2,000 buy-in. The series will run from September 3-9, and will feature a range of different formats, including No Limit Hold’em and Pot Limit Omaha.

The series is being launched in partnership with the New Zealand Poker Tour (NZPT), which is the leading provider of live poker tournaments in the country. In addition to the $2,000 buy-ins, the NZPT is also offering a range of side events and satellites, which give players a chance to win seats into the main events.

Commenting on the launch, David Lighty, Director of Live Events for PokerStars, said: “We are excited to be partnering with the NZPT for our very first Lighty NZPT. This series offers something for everyone with a variety of different formats and buy-ins. We expect it to be popular with both recreational players and seasoned pros alike.”

Jamie Hughes, CEO of the NZPT added: “We are very pleased to be working with PokerStars on this exciting new venture. The Lighty NZPT gives our players something extra to look forward to during our flagship tour this year. We anticipate that it will be hugely popular with all levels of player.”

With its convenient location and well-established poker scene, New Zealand is an ideal market for PokerStars. The company has been steadily increasing its presence in the country over recent years, and the launch of the Lighty NZPT is further evidence of its commitment to growing the game Down Under.
